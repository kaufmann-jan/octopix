# octopix
octopix is a small, lightweight GUI for showing / plotting (mainly) OpenFOAM time series data, generated by OF's function objects.

## Installation

Set up a local virtual environment and install from the repo. This keeps the
PyQt5 dependency isolated and ensures the bundled `octopost` dependency is
pulled from GitHub.

```bash
python3 -m venv --prompt octopix .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

If you change the Qt resource file (`octopix/resources/resources.qrc`) or add
new assets, regenerate the compiled resources module:

```bash
pyrcc5 -o octopix/resources/resources.py octopix/resources/resources.qrc
```

Run the app from the project root:

```bash
python -m octopix
```
