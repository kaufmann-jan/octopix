# octopix
octopix is a small, lightweight GUI for showing / plotting (mainly) OpenFOAM time series data, generated by OF's function objects.

## Installation

You can install directly from the repo URL, or use an editable install for
development. Either way, it is recommended to use a virtual environment because
of the Qt and `octopost` dependencies.

Install from the repo URL:

```bash
python3 -m venv --prompt octopix .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install "octopix @ git+https://github.com/kaufmann-jan/octopix@main"
```

For development (clone + editable install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaufmann-jan/octopix.git
cd octopix
python3 -m venv --prompt octopix .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

If you change the Qt resource file (`octopix/resources/resources.qrc`) or add
new assets, regenerate the compiled resources module:

```bash
pyrcc5 -o octopix/resources/resources.py octopix/resources/resources.qrc
```

Run the app from the project root:

```bash
python -m octopix
```

The `octopix` script is installed via the `project.scripts` entry, so you can also run it
as long as your virtual environment is active:

```bash
octopix
```
